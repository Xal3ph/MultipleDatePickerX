#What is MultipleDatePickerX ?
MultipleDatePickerX is an based on the Angular directive "MultipleDatePicker".  "MultipleDatePicker" was made show a simple calendar allowing user to select multiple dates.  This library is more complicated than the simple version.  It allows for multiple calendars, different calendar modes, it requires more advanced libraries (qtip) and does some more things than the original plugin.
